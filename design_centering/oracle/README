Mapping Generator for DC Oracle
===============================

This python classes are intended for a cooperativ use with the SLX toolchain 
and the DC algorithm.

config.py
- Contains paths to the SLX toolchain, an abstract description of 
  the architecture, and the configuration of the perturbation generator.

oracle.py
- Code to run the oracle (currently used from matlab DC-implementation)

perturbation.py
- Provides a stand alone perturbation-test for found design centers.

projection.py
- A class to produce various visualizations from log-files for 
  design-center or perturbation runs. 

mapping_utils.py
- Provides a MappingGenerator that is used to generate full SLX-mapping-XMLs 
  from vectors.
- This class is used from oracle, perturbation, and projection classes as well.

slxmapping.py
- Parser for SLX-mapping-XMLs that were provided by SLX toolchain.
